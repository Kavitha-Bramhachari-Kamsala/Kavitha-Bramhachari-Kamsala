- 👀  I’m interested in the intersection of data, technology, and human behavior. I love analyzing datasets to identify patterns that can lead to meaningful change, whether in business            strategy, social issues, or sustainability efforts.
- 🌱  I’m currently learning advanced data visualization with Python libraries like Plotly, enhancing my SQL proficiency, and diving deeper into predictive analytics and machine learning models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects that make a difference—especially those focusing on social impact, business optimization, or sustainability.
